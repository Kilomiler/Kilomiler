- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kilomiler
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code! Pretty simple.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Python, but I'm dipping my toes into HTML, CSS, and javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects for beginners (because I'm a baby when it comes to how things work, sorry!)
- 📫 How to reach me? > https://bsky.app/profile/kilomiler.bsky.social or as kilomiler on discord!
